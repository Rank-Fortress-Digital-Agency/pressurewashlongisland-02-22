The pressure washer can also be attached directly to a garden hose for convenience purposes if desired by the user.</p>

                    <h2>Why you should pressure wash your home’s exterior?</h2>
                    <p>Pressure Washing Long Island. With the high concentration of salt and sand on the roadways, as well as airborne pollutants such as pollen and bird dander, your home’s exterior is exposed to a lot more than just dirt and grime. Exterior surfaces should be pressure washed at least once per year, not only to beautify it, but also to protect the exterior of your home.</p>
                    <p>Pressure washing is an effective way to clean all kinds of surfaces. It involves passing pressurized water through or across something in order to remove dirt or other materials that are stuck to it. The high-pressure stream of water often dislodges the things stuck to the surface, which will fall away and ideally be carried away by the flow of water.</p>
